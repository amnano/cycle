After testing dozens of epilators, we found the best options for every need and budget.

## What is the Best Epilator?

### Best for Beginners: Philips Series 8000

The [Philips Series 8000](http://iink.club/phil8) has a ton of accessories for you to get used to epilating, learn what you need and prefer. It even comes with a guide to hold the device properly.

**Why it's great:**

- More gentle than other options with ceramic tweezers that don't heat like metal ones
- Known to be more hygienic and easier to repair
- Has premium epilator features (wide epilating head) but for half the price in most countries

---

### Best Value: Braun Silk-épil 7

The [Braun Silk-épil 7](http://iink.club/silk7) is our top pick for these reasons:

- Easy to clean the inside gears to keep your epilator super clean. Remember, a clean epilator means fewer pimples
- You can change its battery if needed, plenty of tutorials on our website
- Has the same amount of tweezers as the [Silk-épil 9](http://iink.club/silk9) and [9 Flex](http://iink.club/9flex), making it just as fast

**It's our favorite, no brainer. Also less expensive than premium epilators.**

---

### Best Budget: Philips Series 4000

The [Philips Series 4000](http://iink.club/phil4) is a corded epilator with two speeds. You'll get constant speed and be able to use it virtually for life if you clean it well.

Perfect for users on a budget who want constant power and long-lasting durability.

---

### Best Premium: Braun Silk-épil 9 Flex

If you have a big budget, the [Braun Silk-épil 9 Flex](http://iink.club/9flex) has premium features like auto speed, which adapts to how strongly you apply the epilator.

**Premium features:**

- Flex head makes it very fast to epilate the whole leg
- I can picture a busy person in a rush doing a whole leg twice as fast as other models
- Super easy to reach complex areas

## How to Choose an Epilator

When choosing an epilator, the most important question: **corded or not?** Will my epilator be plugged in at all times during sessions, or do I want battery power?

### To make this choice:

**Go corded if:**

- You are on a budget and plan to use your epilator for very long sessions

**Go cordless if:**

- You like the idea of epilating in the shower to reduce pain or make it more bearable

**Full body sessions:**

- The battery option will let you reach every area freely, but you might need to charge twice
- Make sure to buy an epilator with quick charge
- The [Silk-épil 9](http://iink.club/silk9) has a 15-minute quick charge that provides 10 minutes of operation time

You might prefer for full body the steady speed of the [Philips corded 4000](http://iink.club/phil4), but you'll have to deal with the cable and a smaller epilation area.

### Maintenance Criteria

Corded epilators can last, virtually, for life. Battery epilators will need a replacement at some point.

That's where the [Silk-épil 7](http://iink.club/silk7) is a great option because you can change its battery (not possible with [Silk-épil 9](http://iink.club/silk9) and [9 Flex](http://iink.club/9flex)).
